# Entrance Dynamics

How are movement dynamics of agents influenced by the design choices of the entrance?
This repository explores this question using agent-based simulations.

### Simulation gifs

All simulations can be viewed in the gifs folder. It contains two simulations with- and without one-directional flow segments. The other factor that varies is whether the door is static or rotates throughout the simulation.
